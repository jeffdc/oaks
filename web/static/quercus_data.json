This only works if there are enough leaves seen in the photo(s).\nThe distal lobing is indicative of Q nigra. Q phellos can have lobing but in my experience and research I believe it will never be distal, only proximal from the midpoint. Another point for Q nigra is that Q phellos does not have the severely constricted proximal portion of the leaf as seen on some of these leaves, towards the upper left in the photo."
