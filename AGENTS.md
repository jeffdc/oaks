# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# AI Agent Instructions

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### GitHub Copilot Integration

If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading.
Run `bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.

### MCP Server (Recommended)

If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:

```bash
pip install beads-mcp
```

Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):
```json
{
  "beads": {
    "command": "beads-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**
```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### CLI Help

Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.
For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.

IMPORTANT: Always Include Issue Descriptions

Issues without descriptions lack context for future work. When creating issues, always include a meaningful description with:

    Why the issue exists (problem statement or need)
    What needs to be done (scope and approach)
    How you discovered it (if applicable during work)

Good examples:

# Bug discovered during work
bd create "Fix auth bug in login handler" \
  --description="Login fails with 500 error when password contains special characters like quotes. Found while testing GH#123 feature. Stack trace shows unescaped SQL in auth/login.go:45." \
  -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-abc --json

# Feature request
bd create "Add password reset flow" \
  --description="Users need ability to reset forgotten passwords via email. Should follow OAuth best practices and include rate limiting to prevent abuse." \
  -t feature -p 2 --json

# Technical debt
bd create "Refactor auth package for testability" \
  --description="Current auth code has tight DB coupling making unit tests difficult. Need to extract interfaces and add dependency injection. Blocks writing tests for bd-xyz." \
  -t task -p 3 --json

Bad examples (missing context):

bd create "Fix auth bug" -t bug -p 1 --json  # What bug? Where? Why?
bd create "Add feature" -t feature --json     # What feature? Why needed?
bd create "Refactor code" -t task --json      # What code? Why refactor?

ZFC (Zero Framework Cognition) Principles

Core Architecture Principle: This application is pure orchestration that delegates ALL reasoning to external AI. We build a “thin, safe, deterministic shell” around AI reasoning with strong guardrails and observability.

✅ ZFC-Compliant (Allowed)

- Pure Orchestration
- IO and Plumbing • Read/write files, list directories, parse JSON, serialize/deserialize • Persist to stores, watch events, index documents
- Structural Safety Checks • Schema validation, required fields verification • Path traversal prevention, timeout enforcement, cancellation handling
- Policy Enforcement • Budget caps, rate limits, confidence thresholds • “Don’t run without approval” gates
- Mechanical Transforms • Parameter substitution (e.g., ${param} replacement) • Compilation • Formatting and rendering AI-provided data
- State Management • Lifecycle tracking, progress monitoring • Mission journaling, escalation policy execution
- Typed Error Handling • Use SDK-provided error classes (instanceof checks) • Avoid message parsing

❌ ZFC-Violations (Forbidden)

- Local Intelligence/Reasoning
- Ranking/Scoring/Selection • Any algorithm that chooses among alternatives based on heuristics or weights
- Plan/Composition/Scheduling • Decisions about dependencies, ordering, parallelization, retry policies
- Semantic Analysis • Inferring complexity, scope, file dependencies • Determining “what should be done next”
- Heuristic Classification • Keyword-based routing • Fallback decision trees • Domain-specific rules
- Quality Judgment • Opinionated validation beyond structural safety • Recommendations like “test-first recommended”

🔄 ZFC-Compliant Pattern

The Correct Flow
1. Gather Raw Context (IO only) • User intent, project files, constraints, mission state
2. Call AI for Decisions • Classification, selection, composition • Ordering, validation, next steps
3. Validate Structure • Schema conformance • Safety checks • Policy enforcement
4. Execute Mechanically • Run AI’s decisions without modification

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
